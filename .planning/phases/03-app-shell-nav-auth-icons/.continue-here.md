<current_state>
Plan 03-01 (app shell + layout) is EXECUTED and committed. Plans 03-02 through 03-05 are WRITTEN but not yet executed. Using subagent-driven development workflow — dispatch one gsd-executor subagent per plan, then review.

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Plan 03-02: User Menu, Breadcrumbs, Dark Mode Toggle — NOT EXECUTED
  - Migrate UserMenu.vue to DropdownMenu + Avatar
  - Migrate AdminHeader breadcrumbs to shadcn-vue Breadcrumb
  - Verify dark mode toggle in AppHeader

- Plan 03-03: Auth Modals and Auth Pages — NOT EXECUTED
  - Rewrite LoginModal, ForgotPasswordModal, ChangePasswordModal with Dialog + vee-validate + Zod
  - Wire LoginModal into AppHeader with v-model:open
  - Rewrite Login.vue and ForgotPassword.vue standalone pages

- Plan 03-04: Toast Replacement — NOT EXECUTED
  - Replace v-snackbar in 9 admin/network views with toast()
  - Replace window.snackbar in 2 composable/view files

- Plan 03-05: Icon Replacement — NOT EXECUTED
  - Create src/utils/icons.ts mapping module (198 entries)
  - Replace all 303 v-icon tags across 64 files with direct Lucide imports
  - Update adminIcons.ts and evidenceTiers.ts
  - Write Vitest tests (TEST-02)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- All icons replaced in Phase 3 (not deferred to later phases)
- All toasts replaced in Phase 3 (not shell-only)
- 3 remaining plans (auth, toasts, icons) instead of 2 — lower risk per plan
- Auth standalone pages (Login.vue, ForgotPassword.vue) in same plan as modals
- Direct Lucide imports per file (no AppIcon bridge component)
- Leave prepend-icon/append-icon Vuetify props for Phases 4-8
- Execution approach: subagent-driven development (gsd-executor per plan)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None — all plans written, 03-01 executed successfully, ready to continue
</blockers>

<context>
Execution order: 03-01 (done) → 03-02 → then 03-03, 03-04, 03-05 (these three are parallel-capable but running sequentially via subagents is safer). Each plan is dispatched to a gsd-executor subagent with the plan file path. After each execution, run spec review then code quality review. Build + lint must pass after each plan.

The 03-01 executor had 3 minor deviations (all auto-fixed): Dialog component manual creation due to CLI prompt, @radix-icons/vue as missing dep, KeyboardEvent ESLint global.

<next_action>
Start with: Execute Plan 03-02 by dispatching a gsd-executor subagent. Read the plan at `.planning/phases/03-app-shell-nav-auth-icons/03-02-PLAN.md`. After execution, verify build + lint, then proceed to 03-03.
