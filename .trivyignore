# OpenSSL CVEs - False Positives (frontend: nginx:1.29-alpine base image)
# =============================================================================
# nginx serves pre-built Vue.js static assets over HTTP/HTTPS. It does NOT:
# - Process untrusted CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) content
# - Parse or validate PKCS#7 / PKCS#12 files from users
# - Handle TimeStamp protocol responses
# - Use OCB encryption mode
# - Run the `openssl dgst` command
# - Handle QUIC connections (QUIC not enabled in our config)
# - Process TLS certificate compression from untrusted sources
# - Use BIO filters with untrusted content
#
# These vulnerabilities require specific OpenSSL API calls or processing
# of malicious cryptographic objects that nginx's TLS termination never exercises.
#
# The upstream Alpine team will patch openssl when fixes are available.

# libpng CVE - False Positive (frontend: nginx:1.29-alpine base image)
# =============================================================================
# nginx serves pre-built static assets (HTML/JS/CSS). It does NOT process,
# decode, or re-encode PNG images. User-uploaded PNGs are never processed
# server-side by nginx. The vulnerable function png_set_quantize() is never called.
