# gosu CVEs - False Positives
# =============================================================================
# gosu is a simple Go binary used only for privilege dropping during container
# startup. It does NOT use the vulnerable code paths in Go's standard library:
# - No tar file parsing (archive/tar)
# - No TLS connections (crypto/tls, crypto/x509)
# - No HTTP client/server (net/http)
# - No email parsing (net/mail)
# - No URL parsing from untrusted sources (net/url)
# - No PEM/ASN.1/DER parsing (encoding/pem, encoding/asn1)
# - No text protocol parsing (net/textproto)
#
# gosu simply: parses CLI args -> looks up user/group -> setuid/setgid -> exec
# These vulnerabilities require specific attack vectors that gosu never exercises.
